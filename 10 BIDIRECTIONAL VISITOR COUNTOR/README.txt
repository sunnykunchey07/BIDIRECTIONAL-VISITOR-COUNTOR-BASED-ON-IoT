Today in this project, will make IoT Based Bidirectional Visitor Counter using NodeMCU ESP8266 & Blynk IoT cloud. This project is useful for monitoring the total number of visitors entering, exiting, and current visitors available from any part of the world using the Blynk IoT cloud platform. Infrared or IR Sensors are used to count the total number of incoming and outcoming visitors. The Visitorsâ€™ data is uploaded automatically to Blynk cloud using the NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module.

You can use this ESP8266 NodeMCU based IoT Bidirectional Visitor counter in the hall, shopping mall, office entrance gate to count the total number of visitors. This device counts the total number of visitors entering through the gate & also counts the total number of visitors exiting through the different gates. Basically, it calculates the total number of current visitors by subtracting the outgoing visitor from the incoming visitor. When a single person enters the room, the light turns on automatically. Whenever there are no visitors present in the room, the light turns off automatically.

Previously, we have made the Visitor Counter Project using Arduino & OLED Display. But this time we will send the data to the Blynk cloud instead of simply watching it on OLED Display.
